Now you can play **DOOM** right inside Revit (I have no idea why, but you can).\
Just go to the Add-ins tab and CLICK **DOOM**.\
You will also need a file .WAD (I cannot provide it as it is owned by Id Software).

# Performance tests
Your values may vary depending on the PC configuration and Revit version.
|Quality|Average FPS|

|Low|~13|
|Medium|~7|
|High|~1|

# Game control
**Attention!** At the time of the game cycle, the application intercepts control at the Windows level.

|W|Move forward|
|S|Move back|
|D|Move to the right|
